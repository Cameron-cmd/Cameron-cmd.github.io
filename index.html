    <h1>Dissertation Project Final Round</h1>
    <h2>Terrain Generation Tool by Cameron Dawes</h2>

    <p>To participate you will need to do the following instructions on a computer.</p>
    <p>Any questions can be directed to my email at cameron.dawes9@gmail.com and I will respond ASAP.</p>
    <p>Please read the <a href="https://1drv.ms/w/s!Ajc-4ewABogYeLMylJND3Qk2KIo?e=eSKgSt" target="_blank">information sheet</a> and then continue on.</p>
    <p>Download the program files off of the <a href="https://github.com/Cameron-cmd/DisertationProjectFile" target="_blank">Github</a> or as a zip file from <a href="https://1drv.ms/f/c/18880600ece13e37/ErZHtClNrg1HvyHftMLaFnoBukHWPnn12NSAS0V-yWFUHg?e=Bt1ZaF" target="_blank">OneDrive</a>.<br/>If OneDrive is not letting you download the files, you can download them individually or go onto the github and click the big green button that says code and download the zip from there.</p>
    <p>After downloading it extract from the zip and run the program and use the tool to complete the tasks below. Just make sure if you have two displays, open it on the main display.</p>
    <p>If you need assistance with the tool there is a youtube tutorial <a href="https://youtu.be/4rQu-K4cXiU" target="_blank">here</a></p>
	<p>Task 1, Generate a diamond square terrain, <br/>Use the hydraulic erosion key shortcut, <br/>Use the smooth all terrain shortcut to smooth the terrain out, <br/>Manipulate the terrain with the brushes using the shortcuts,<br />Undo and Redo some of your edits,<br/>Export it,<br />Generate a new terrain,<br />Load your exported terrain back into the tool,<br />Manipulate it with the height slider.</p>
    <p>Task 2, Generate a large noise terrain using two or more noises with octaves, <br/>Adjust this terrain to have mountains and flat planes, <br/>Create a river system and lakes, <br/>Set the colour of the terrain,<br/>Export the heightmap,<br/>Load it back in,<br/>Adjust it with the height slider to replicate how it was previously</p>
	<p>Task 3, Find a (square)heightmap image online, <br/>Adjust the height</p>
    <p>For features it currently has:<br />Terrain Generation with the Diamond Square algorithm<br/>Terrain Generation with noise<br />Hydraulic Erosion with controls<br />Export terrain model as a .glb file<br />Export height map of terrain as .png file<br/>Import height map to be used for terrain<br/>Import .glb file(currently only ones made by the tool itself)<br/>Brushes to adjust terrain<br />Colour tools<br />Wireframe view</p>
    <p>After using the tool fill out the <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=8nivV33IZkS3u2tsyZ7RJJM5mgmDUVBDt6Er7jzo33FUMTUyUjAyUzBSV0lNRjdTMkVWOFhWWlNERS4u" target="_blank">questionnaire.</a></p>
    <p>All done! Thank you for participating in the final round. If you would like to share this with colleagues and friends that would help a lot.</p>
    <p>After some time I will send out the questionnaire again to get feedback on added features and improvements.</p>
