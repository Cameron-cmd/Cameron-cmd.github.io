    <h1>Dissertation Project</h1>
    <h2>Terrain Generation Tool by Cameron Dawes</h2>

    <p>To participate you will need to do the following instructions on a computer.</p>
    <p>Any questions can be directed to my email at cameron.dawes9@gmail.com and I will respond ASAP.</p>
    <p>Please read the <a href="https://1drv.ms/w/s!Ajc-4ewABogYeLMylJND3Qk2KIo?e=eSKgSt" target="_blank">information sheet</a> and then continue on.</p>
    <p>Download the program files off of the <a href="https://github.com/Cameron-cmd/DisertationProjectFile" target="_blank">Github</a> or as a zip file from <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ajc-4ewABogYesRzQTEgncXRBEA?e=ACDFMb" target="_blank">OneDrive</a>.</p>
    <p>After downloading it run the program and use the tool.</p>
    <p>For features it currently has: Terrain Generation with the Diamond Square algorithm, Terrain Generation with noise, Hydraulic Erosion and the ability to save the terrain as an OBJ file</p>
    <p>After using the tool fill out the <a href="https://forms.office.com/e/t82kswk0vj" target="_blank">questionnaire.</a></p>
    <p>All done! Thank you for participating. If you would like to share this with colleagues and friends that would help a lot.</p>
    <p>After some time I will send out the questionnaire again to get feedback on added features and improvements.</p>
