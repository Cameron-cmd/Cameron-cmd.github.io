    <h1>Dissertation Project Round 3</h1>
    <h2>Terrain Generation Tool by Cameron Dawes</h2>

    <p>To participate you will need to do the following instructions on a computer.</p>
    <p>Any questions can be directed to my email at cameron.dawes9@gmail.com and I will respond ASAP.</p>
    <p>Please read the <a href="https://1drv.ms/w/s!Ajc-4ewABogYeLMylJND3Qk2KIo?e=eSKgSt" target="_blank">information sheet</a> and then continue on.</p>
    <p>Download the program files off of the <a href="https://github.com/Cameron-cmd/DisertationProjectFile" target="_blank">Github</a> or as a zip file from <a href="https://1drv.ms/f/c/18880600ece13e37/EpreNdj6d8FDtcKHPGRdWhUBWsU644s3eED5BVAMRnJ80Q?e=Ha4x5c" target="_blank">OneDrive</a>.</p>
    <p>After downloading it run the program and use the tool to complete the tasks below. Just make sure if you have two displays, open it on the main display.</p>
    <p>Task 1, Generate a diamond square terrain, <br/>Use hydraulic erosion to erode it, <br/>Use the smooth brush to smooth the terrain as hyrdraulic erosion is quite bumpy (you can use a high brush size), <br/>Then colour in what you would like to be a river, <br/>Finally export it as a ply file and then load the file you just saved back into the tool.</p>
    <p>Below is an example image of what your task 1 could look like.<p/>
	<img src="Task1.png" alt="Task1">
    <p></p>
    <p>Task 2, Generate a noise terrain that is reasonably mountainous, <br/>Then use hydraulic erosion once more, <br/>Followed by that use the raise brush to connect some of the mountains and use the lower brush to create some valleys, <br/>Save this as a height map and reload the height map back into the tool and adjust it with the height slider to look as close to the original terrain as possible.</p>
    <p>The image below is an example of what the task 2 terrain could look like before hydraulic erosion.<p/>
	<img src="Task2.png" alt="Task2">
    <p>For features it currently has:<br />Terrain Generation with the Diamond Square algorithm<br/>Terrain Generation with noise and with control such as noise octaves<br />Hydraulic Erosion with controls<br />Export terrain model as a .ply file<br />Export height map of terrain as .png file<br/>Import height map to be used for terrain<br/>Import ply files(currently only ones made by the tool itself)<br/>Brushes to adjust terrain<br />Wireframe view</p>
    <p>After using the tool fill out the <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=8nivV33IZkS3u2tsyZ7RJJM5mgmDUVBDt6Er7jzo33FUOUhYSlhTOE9NREs3RVBRNjUwNlpLNE9TRy4u" target="_blank">questionnaire.</a></p>
    <p>All done! Thank you for participating in round 3. If you would like to share this with colleagues and friends that would help a lot.</p>
    <p>After some time I will send out the questionnaire again to get feedback on added features and improvements.</p>
