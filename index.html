    <h1>Dissertation Project</h1>
    <h2>Terrain Generation Tool by Cameron Dawes</h2>

    <p>To start with can you read the <a href="https://1drv.ms/w/s!Ajc-4ewABogYeLMylJND3Qk2KIo?e=ApG81N" target="_blank">Information Sheet</a> along with filling in and submiting the <a href="https://1drv.ms/w/s!Ajc-4ewABogYdpR3ApK1EIgozIg?e=cYscbd" target="_blank">Consent Form</a> to my email at cameron.dawes9@gmail.com</p>
    <p>Then download the program files off of the <a href="https://github.com/Cameron-cmd/DisertationProjectFile" target="_blank">Github</a> or as a zip file from <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ajc-4ewABogYdXEBXXP7T0_a7p4?e=XLkELc" target="_blank">OneDrive</a>.</p>
    <p>After downloading it run the program and use the tool.</p>
    <p>For features it currently has: Terrain Generation with the Diamond Square algorithm, Terrain Generation with noise, Hydraulic Erosion and the ability to save the terrain as an OBJ file</p>
    <p>After using the tool fill out the <a href="https://forms.office.com/e/t82kswk0vj" target="_blank">questionnaire</a></p>
    <p>All done! Thank you for participating. If you would like to share this with colleagues and friends that would help a lot.</p>
    <p>After some time I will send out the questionnaire again to get feedback on added features and improvements.</p>
